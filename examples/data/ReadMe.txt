
Example1.txt
: Data file with two rows of numbers.
  It is standard scalar (x,y)-type data.

Example2.txt
: Data file with four rows of numbers.
  It is scalar (x,y)-type data with upper and lower error bars.

Example3.txt
: Data file with two rows of numbers and a row of strings.
  It is scalar (x,y)-type data with tick labels.

Example4.txt
: Data file with four rows of numbers and a row of strings.
  It is scalar (x,y)-type data with upper/lower error bars and tick labels.

Example5.txt
: Data file with two rows of numbers.
  It is scalar (x,y)-type data.
  The y-values are generated by the exponential function exp(-x),
  so it is typical data for the logarithmic scale.

Example6.txt
: Data file with five rows of numbers.
  It is typical data for the scalar "Multiple XY" graph.

Example7.txt
: Data file with four rows of numbers.
  It is typical data with x-values generated by sampling and multiple y-values.

Example8.txt
: Data file with a row of strings of date and a row of numbers.
  It is standard scalar date-(x,y)-type data.

Example9.txt
: Data file with a row of strings of date and three rows of numbers.
  It is scalar date-(x,y)-type data with upper and lower error bars.

Example10.txt
: Data file with a row of strings of date, a row of numbers and a row of strings.
  It is scalar date-(x,y)-type data with tick labels.

Example11.txt
: Data file with a row of strings of date, three rows of numbers and a row of strings.
  It is scalar date-(x,y)-type data with upper and lower error bars and tick labels.

Example12.txt
: Data file with four rows of numbers.
  It is standard vector (x,y)-type data with x and y components of vectors.

Example13.txt
: Data file with four rows of numbers.
  It is standard vector (x,y)-type data with magnitude and angle of vectors.

Example14.txt
: Data file with three rows of numbers.
  It is standard scalar (x,y,z)-type data.

Example15.nc
: NetCDF data file with variables of x, y, time and height.
  It is standard scalar (x,y,z)-type data.

Example16.nc
: NetCDF data file with variables of x, y, height, lower error and upper error. 
  It is scalar (x,y)-type data with upper and lower error bars.
